          Sometimes life becomes too much to handle, leaving us with nothing but
          questions. Hope may seem far away in those circumstances. Our attitude
          toward the One who is waiting to hear us changes as a result of
          prayer, which is a wonderful thing. Whatever youâ€™re dealing with, we
          would love to pray for you!
